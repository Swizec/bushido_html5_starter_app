Bushido HTML5 Starter APP
============================================================
About
-----
This is an app that's deployable in one-click to Bushido, a robust and completely open hosting platform for Rails 2, Rails 3, Sinatra, and of course, HTML5 apps.
        
Customizing and deployment
--------------------------
Simply for this repo (there's a 'fork' button up above), and copy your git url into the box at [http://bushi.do/][1]. You can even edit it in your browser via GitHub's interface!

Other Steps
-----------
There aren't any... but maybe we can some extra steps.

1.) After deploying, be sure to check out the local Salsa Dance classes.
2.) Rub your tummy vigorously. Alternatively, [rub your cat's tummy vigorously][7].
3.) Nothing, just use your app!

Examples
--------
Here are the famous HTML5 rocks slides deployed on Bushido - [link][2], [repo][3]
